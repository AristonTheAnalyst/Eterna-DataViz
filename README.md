## Project Overview

This is the first project in my 2025 professional portfolio

The aim of this project was to build a fleshed out Tableau dashboard rich with features, but still realistically practical for real-world use.

This project utilizes python for data generation, data analysis, cleaning and transformation, Tableau for visuals.

## Notes
There is no commit history as I didn't yet know how to practice version control and documentation with Git, since this project, I have always been using Git for documentation/version control.
