# [Eterna Human Resources Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ariston.zubiri/viz/EternaHRDashboard/HRSummary?publish=yes)

## Project Overview

This is the first project in my 2025 professional portfolio.

The aim of this project was to build a comprehensive Tableau dashboardâ€”rich in features yet grounded in real-world practicality.

The project uses Python for data generation, analysis, cleaning, and transformation, and Tableau for data visualization.

## Notes

There is no commit history for this project, as I had not yet learned how to use Git for version control and documentation. Since completing this project, I have consistently used Git for both.
